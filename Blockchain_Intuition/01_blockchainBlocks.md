The first block is known as Genesis Block.

Lets, talk about blocks

Block 1 (Genesis Block): {               Block 2: {                              Block 3: {
    Data: .....                             Data: .....                             Data: .....
    Prev. Hash: 000000000        ==         Prev. Hash: 034DFA127        ==         Prev. Hash: 4ACF18F52
    Hash: 034DFA127                         Hash: 4ACF18F52                         Hash: 7F2AEC4F0
}                                        }                                       }

Here if we do change in any block hash will change. Hash is like a finger print and all blocks are connected with hash.
