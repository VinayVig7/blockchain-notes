A distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network architecture where multiple devices (or "peers") communicate and share resources directly with each other without relying on a central server or authority. In such a network, each participant (peer) can act as both a client and a server, enabling decentralized interaction and the sharing of data or resources.

Key Characteristics of a Distributed P2P Network:
1. Decentralization
2. Direct Communication
3. Resource Sharing
4. Fault Tolerance and Redundancy
5. Scalability
6. Security and Trust
