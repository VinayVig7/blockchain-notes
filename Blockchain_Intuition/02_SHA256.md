1. SHA256 stands for secured hash algorithm and 256 is number of bits it takes in memory
2. Hash is of 64 characters and it can be number as well as letter also.
3. Hash is hexadecimal which means it contain 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F and each of them has 4 bits. 4*16=64
4. If we do slight change in data whole hash changes

5. The five requirements for Hash algorithms
    a. One way - very hard to reverse meaning you will find it very difficult to get data from hash.
    b. Deterministic - the same input will always produce the same hash output.
    c. Fast computation - ability to efficiently calculate the hash value for a given input, which is a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) output.
    d. The avalanche effect - if we do a slight change in data the whole hash will change
    e. Must withstand collisions -  a hash function should never produce the same output (hash) for two different inputs.
