1. Bitcoin is no just a coin it is a protocol like http and other protocols

2. You should know the differnce between coins and tokens.

3. Coins are the protocol itself like bitcoin is protocol and the btc is coin. Other examples of coins are :- Eth, Sol etc.

4. Tokens are not protocol they are present under protocols like usdt, usdc etc.

5. Yeah, In the protocol there are people with different role like Nodes, Miners, Institutional Miners, Mining Pools.

6. As we know, there are only 21 million supply of btc and yet all coins are not released miners get rewarded with each successfull block and we also know about halving how halving works after every 4 years reward for miners for successfully adding blocks is divided by half like in 2024 this is 3.125BTC per block with this data and mathamatical calculation full supply of btc will be released in the year 2140.

7. Current difficult for miners to find golden nonce is hash with leading 18 zeros so probability to find golden nonce by random picking hash is (2 x 10^55)/(10^77) = 2 x 10^-22 which equals to 0.0000000000000000002%.

8. Btc miners joins mining pool where they get rewarded according to their hashing power more hashing power more the reward.

9. Miners have to find nonce ranging between 0 to 4 billion which means if the golden nonce is not there between this range what should miners do then?   Thats why timestamp is also present in there after every second hash changes again and miners have to find golden hash again plus there is block configuration where miners have to choose which transection they have to pick so thats also help in finding nonce by keep on changing block transections.   The Bitcoin network hash rate in 2025 is approximately 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). 1 exahash (EH) = 1 quintillion (10^18) hashes per second. 

10. CPU's GPU's were used to mine btc in past yes you can use it now but it will be loss deed for you. Some protocols like eth can be minned using GPU's. For btc mining ASIC'S are used they are speciallized in solving sha256 puzzle. Other protocols like eth use different algo ETHhash for mining. This algo is AISC resistent. GPU's are used. But now eth use proof of stake(POS).

11. Orphaned blocks - we already know about this but little bit more knowledge it is not necssary if out of 2 blocks which are mined at same time the block which is mined first will join the chain and other will be removed the chain which will find next block first will join the chain and the longest chain will continue.

12. Mempool stands for ‚ÄúMemory Pool‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a waiting room for transactions üïí ‚Äî where all pending transactions sit before they‚Äôre added to a block and written permanently on the blockchain.

13. A 51% attack happens when a single miner or group of miners controls more than 50% of the total hashing power (or computational power) of a blockchain network. Once someone has over 50%, they can essentially control the blockchain in some very dangerous ways. üò¨With 51%+ control, an attacker could:

‚úÖ Do:
Double spend coins (send, then reverse the transaction).

Prevent confirmations of others‚Äô transactions.

Temporarily stop mining by others or delay blocks.

Create longer alternative chains that override the honest one.
