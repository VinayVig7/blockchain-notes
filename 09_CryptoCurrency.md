1. UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. In Bitcoin, when someone sends you coins, what you receive isn't a balance in an account â€” it's a specific chunk of coins called a UTXO. You can only spend it whole or send the remainder back to yourself as change.

2. To understand UTXO easily lets take a example suppose chetan sends me 0.1 BTC and manjinder sends me 0.5 BTC and amerchod sends me 0.4 BTC. In total I have now 1 BTC but I cant use this btc directly I have to go through UTXO's. Now, lets suppose I want to buy one telescope which will cost me around 0.8 BTC. Here is the process through which I can buy telescope through BTC:-
First I have to check all my UTXO'S and then I have to pick UTXO'S which can sum up and get equals to desired amount or more.
So, in my case i have to pick manjinder and amerchod UTXO'S which equals to 0.9 BTC. Then I have to send 0.8 BTC to telescope seller plus 0.08 BTC back to my wallet and remaining 0.02 BTC I am giving to miner to accept my transection from mempool and add in block. This is the way we can do transection on Bitcoin protocol. Now question arrises in manjinder head 'I never did this kind of hardwork to complete my transection on BTC chain'. The reason behind this is wallets(UNISAT) manage all these things on their own but the transections on larger scale manage all things manually. 

3. As per April 2025 there are total 60 million individual UTXO'S. 

4. Wallets on BTC works with this same criteria the balance they show in our wallets is sum of all UTXO.

5. (Segregated witness) - Normally, each transaction in that suitcase has two parts:
  a. The actual transaction (who sent how much to whom)
  b. A signature (proof that the sender is allowed to send it)
ðŸ§³ The problem: The suitcase (block) can only carry 1 MB of data. The signatures take up a lot of space, so only a few transactions fit inside.

6. Public key vs Address :- You can recieve funds either on address or public key but the safe option is to always revieve on address. But, there is one drawback whenever you send fund to anyone from that address you will share your public key too on chain which can be easily access by anyone who uses that protocol means hackers in future can steal your funds with advance technology. Now question arrises if this thing happens many people will loss thier funds. The answer is (bitcoin, ethereum) teams are finding the best way to keep it safe but still they claim in 10-20 years quantum computers can solve the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC algo) and can find your private key through public key. Therefore, team are making quantum resistent algos to keep it safe.
